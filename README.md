## Pneumonia Detection from Chest X-ray 
[Pneumonia](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/pneumonia) is a form of acute respiratory infection that affects the lungs. The lungs are made up of small sacs called alveoli, which fill with air when a healthy person breathes. When an individual has pneumonia, the alveoli are filled with pus and fluid, which makes breathing painful and limits oxygen intake.

### Goal
The aim was to take the dataset which contains X-Ray images, divided into normal and pneumonia, and to train a traditional (classification) machine learning algorithm to be able to detect the pneumonia cases.

#### Organization
- Each branch houses a model in a folder that will contain documents concerning it
- The folder will be named in the same way as the model it concerns
